# `dungeon-ats`

This repository contains a small "port" of my [Dungeon][dun] project
(originally implemented in Java) to [ATS][ats].

This ATS version of the project is missing many essential features.
For example, it contains no network code at all, so every universe
can only be played in single-player. In this sense it is more of a
standard text-adventure game engine.
